Key Configuration Commands (Examples)

Creating VLAN:
enable conf t vlan 10 name dept A exit interface range fa0/1 - 24 switchport mode access switchport access vlan 10 exit write memory

Router Interface Setup:
enable conf t interface gig0/0 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0 description dept A no shutdown exit interface gig0/1 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0 description dept B no shutdown exit write memory
Connectivity Testing and Troubleshooting

Ping tests conducted:
PCs within the same VLAN successfully ping each other.
Initial ping attempts across VLANs fail due to ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) table population.
Subsequent pings succeed once ARP tables are populated, demonstrating normal network behavior.

Important insights:
The first ping to a new device may time out as the network learns the routing path.
The router acts as the default gateway for each VLAN, enabling inter-VLAN communication through routing.
Switches handle VLAN segmentation by assigning ports to specific VLANs.
