Key Insights and Conclusions
Building VLAN-separated networks with Cisco Packet Tracer is straightforward when following proper configuration steps.
Proper IP addressing and VLAN configuration on switches and router interfaces are crucial for segmentation and routing.
Initial ping failures during network testing are expected due to ARP learning and should not indicate misconfiguration.
Using consistent port assignment strategies (e.g., last ports for router connections) allows easier future network expansion.
This tutorial provides foundational skills in network design, VLAN setup, and basic troubleshooting.
